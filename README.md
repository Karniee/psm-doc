*Welcome PSMs*
#let's do some basic git things

- create an account at http://www.github.com
- go to http://github.com/pljakobs/psm-doc (that's what you're looking at)
- you can use the built in github text editor, to edit textfile.md
	- check out the icon liste above the file box. On the very left, you see a button labeled "main" - that's the branch you're currently viewing.
	- if you click it, you can enter a name into the text field and thereby create a new branch. Do that
	- now, using the same button, you can switch between the existing branches (they might be yours or those created by others)
	- in your newly created branch, select the textfile.txt and click the edit button on the bottom right. Modify the file, enter your commit comment and press "commit" - you've just committed to your branch.
